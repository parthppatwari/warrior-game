this is my first game as a 23 yo using godot and it is golden
it is so easy to make games on it and I am thinking of making my games available to everyone on steam
I will try not to keep any in game purchases, and just the buying cost that's all.
but if the future me became greedy and fell for the money trap which is most likely not possible
I will try to deliver a good experience to all the player playing my game
I will try to make my games available to all the age group, from child to grand parents/old people.

alright that's all. wish me luck
